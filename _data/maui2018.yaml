  - title: One more of the first sunset...

  - title: Pool Afternoon
    caption: The tide was rising and Ka'anapali was disappearing so we hunkered down by the pool, where we ended up spending a lot of time during our trip.

  - title: The Lanai
    caption: One of the most memorable moments from our trip was stargazing with a couple bottles of wine from the lanai off our room. One of the best parts of Maui's climate is the temperature only drops to about 70 degrees at night. Swoon!

  - title: Open Water
    caption: We were both mesmermized by this view from the room. Still in disbelief we got to wake up to this for a few mornings.

  - title: Another Sunset
    caption: Dinner options at the hotel were way too expensive for the quality of food, so we walked 20 minutes along a beach path to Whaler's Village most nights for dinner. The best part is we got to watch the sunset as we strolled.

    caption: If that's not paradise, we don't know what is.

  - title: Palm Trees as Windsocks
    caption: Whenever we wanted to know if the wind was blowing, the best way to find out was looking at the palm trees. They were blowing hard along the Ka'anapali beach walk as we waited to board for our whale watching tour.

  - title: Whale Watching by Catamaran
    caption: We boarded an early bird whale watching tour and depsite the wind, this catamaran was stable. We got lucky and saw at least 10 humpbacks either exhaling through their blowspouts, flipping up their tails, or in the case of one calf, doing several jumps out of the water. It was quite a show!

  - title: Sandy Waves
    caption: Brian had intended to do some snorkelling while we were there, but the wind had the water near our hotel rough and murky. Next time, we'll have to go on a snorkel tour to see the turtles and abundant underwater life.

  - title: Goodbye Selfie
    caption: We checked out of our hotel at 11am and weren't getting picked up by the taxi to head to the airport until 8pm, so we rode the shuttle into Lahaina Town for lunch, then got tipsy at happy hour in Whaler's Village. It was hard saying goodbye, but we are thankful to have spent a week in paradise!

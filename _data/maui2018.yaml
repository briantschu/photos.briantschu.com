  - title: He's got it :)
    caption: Tom used this photo for his first tweet after a long hiatus. He's wearing a sweatshirt his friends made.

  - title: Sunset at Kahekili Beach
    caption: We never made it back to this beach for sunbathing, but it was a perfect first sunset. The hotel where we stayed is in the background.

  - title: Warm water?
    caption: We dipped our toes in the water and it felt chilly at first but at 76 degrees, you get used to it fast.

  - title: One more of the first sunset...
    caption: Brian is obsessed with sunset photos, so he's exerting self control in this album, but here's one more from the first night. This was taken from the 8th floor of one of the buildings at our resort. Ka'anapali Beach is to the left, and the island Lanai to the right.

  - title: Ka'anapali Beach Morning
    caption: We couldn't wait to get out in the sun on Monday morning! After a trip by Shuttle bus to stock up on snacks at Safeway, we made it to our happy place. Brian went swimming while Tom basked in the sun.

  - title: Pool Afternoon
    caption: The tide was rising and Ka'anapali was disappearing so we hunkered down by the pool, where we ended up spending a lot of time during our trip.

  - title: The Lanai
    caption: One of the most memorable moments was stargazing with a couple bottles of wine from the lanai off our room. One of the best parts of Maui's climate is the temperature only drops to about 70 degrees at night. Swoon!
    filename: "07"

  - title: Open Water
    caption: We were both mesmermized by this view from the room. Still in disbelief we got to wake up to this for a few mornings.
    filename: "08"

  - title: Another Sunset
    caption: Dinner options at the hotel were way too expensive for the quality of food, so we walked 20 minutes along a beach path to Whaler's Village most nights for dinner. The best part is we got to watch the sunset as we strolled.
    filename: "09"

  - title: Dropping Behind Lanai
    caption: If that's not paradise, we don't know what is.
    filename: "10"

  - title: A wider Ka'anapali
    caption: As we ventured further south when the tide was out, we saw Ka'anapali get a bit bigger.
    filename: "11"

  - title: Sunrise Lighting up Lanai
    caption: During the luau we went to, we learned that Maui is connected with several surrounding islands. During the ice age since the oceans weren't as deep, the one visible landmass was known as Maui Nui.
    filename: "12"

  - title: Palm Trees as Windsocks
    caption: Whenever we wanted to know if the wind was blowing, the best way to find out was looking at the palm trees. They were blowing hard along the Ka'anapali beach walk as we waited to board for our whale watching tour.
    filename: "13"

  - title: One more of Lanai
    caption: The pinks and greens and blues were just to beautiful to not share.
    filename: "14"

  - title: Whale Watching by Catamaran
    caption: We boarded an early bird whale watching tour and depsite the wind, this catamaran was stable. We got lucky and saw at least 10 humpbacks either exhaling through their blow holes, flipping up their tails, or in the case of one calf, doing several jumps out of the water. It was quite a show!

  - title: Sunrise over West Maui Mountains
    caption: As we were out on the water, we caught this glimpse of the sun peeking out behind the West Maui Mountains.
    filename: "16"

  - title: Sandy Waves
    caption: Brian had intended to do some snorkelling while we were there, but the wind made the water near our hotel rough and murky. Next time, we'll have to go on a snorkel tour to see the turtles, abundant underwater life, and sparkling clear water.

  - title: Teal Waters
    caption: It was interesting to see the color of the water change throughout the day. This teal is so gorgeous!
    filename: "18"

  - title: White Caps and Clouds
    caption: While the weather was unquestionably beautiful, we did hear that it was a lot more windy than usual with gusts up to 50 miles per hour at some points.
    filename: "19"

  - title: Hi!
    caption: When the second-to-last day of the trip rolled around, we realized we hadn't taken many pictures of us! Using a self timer and a tripod we captured this one :)
    filename: "20"

  - title: Waves Crashing
    caption: Waves crashing at Lionel's Point.
    filename: "21"

  - title: Kahekili Beach
    caption: You can't see it from the photo, but sand was blowing in our faces while we captured this one.
    filename: "22"

  - title: Goodbye Selfie
    caption: We checked out of our hotel at 11am and weren't getting picked up by the taxi to head to the airport until 8pm, so we rode the shuttle into Lahaina for lunch, then got tipsy at happy hour in Whaler's Village. It was hard saying goodbye, but we are thankful to have spent a week in paradise!
